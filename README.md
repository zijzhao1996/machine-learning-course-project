# Project 1: Automatic Review Analyzer 

The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively.

**Results:

1. Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.

2. Use classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.

3. Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.
