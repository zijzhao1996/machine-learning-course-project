## Project 1: Automatic Review Analyzer 

The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. Our training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively.

**Results:**

1. Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.

2. Use classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.

3. Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.


## Project 2: Digit recognition of MNIST Dataset

**Results:**

1. Implement linear regression, support vector machine from scratch.

2. Implement principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction, polynomial and Gaussian RBF kernels.

3. Implement neural network model from scratch. Use PyTorch to classify MNIST digits and then use convolutional layers to boost performance.


## Project 3: Collaborative Filtering via Gaussian Mixtures: Netfilx Dataset

We build a mixture model for collaborative filtering. You are given a data matrix containing movie ratings made by users where the matrix is extracted from a much larger Netflix database. Any particular user has rated only a small fraction of the movies so the data matrix is only partially filled. The goal is to predict all the remaining entries of the matrix.

**Results:**

1. Implement K-means algorithm and EM algorithm from scratch.

2. Build a mixture model for collaborative filtering.
